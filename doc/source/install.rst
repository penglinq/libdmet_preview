Installation with pip
=====================

This is the recommended way to install libDMET::

  $ pip install libDMET_preview

The pip package provides a precompiled libDMET code (python wheel) which
works on almost all Linux systems, and most of Mac OS X systems, and
the Ubuntu subsystems on Windows 10. If you already have installed
PySCF via pip, you can upgrade it to the new version with::

  $ pip install --upgrade libDMET_preview

Installing the latest code on GitHub with pip
---------------------------------------------
The latest code on github can be installed with::

  $ pip install git+https://github.com/penglinq/libDMET_preview

  $ pip install git+https://github.com/penglinq/libDMET_preview@<branch_name>
